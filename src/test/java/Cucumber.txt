1) A Step Definition is a Java method with an expression that links it to one or more Gherkin steps. 
2) When Cucumber executes a Gherkin step in a scenario, it will look for a matching step definition to execute.
3) Cucumber finds the Step Definition file with the help of the Glue code in Cucumber Options.
4) By storing state in instance variables, a step definition can transfer state to a subsequent step definition.


Once the Feature file is created, we need to create a class called Runner class to run the tests. 
This class will use the JUnit annotation @RunWith(), which tells JUnit what is the test runner class.

We cannot run a Feature file on its own in a cucumber-based framework. We need to create a Java class, which will run the Feature File. 
It is the starting point for JUnit to start executing the tests. TestRunner class is created under src/test/java.
 In this tutorial, Cucumber uses the JUnit framework to run the tests. Apart from JUnit, 
 we can also use the TestNG Test Runner class to run the cucumber tests.
