======================Serialization and Deserialization in Rest Assured=============================

1) Serialization in Rest Assured context is a process of converting Java Object into Request body(payload)
2) Rest Assured also supports deserialization by converting Response body back to Java Object.


Advantages:
1. Easy to parse and extract response(JSON/XML) values if they are wrapped as Java Object.
2. User friendly methods can be created which makes code more readable.

Design Approach

1. Java Object is constructed with the support of POJO classes.
2. POJO classes are created based on the request/Response Payload


What are additional Libraries required?

For Json you need to have either Jackson, Jackson2, GSON or Johnzon in the classpath and for XML you need JAXB.

POJO - Plain Object Java
